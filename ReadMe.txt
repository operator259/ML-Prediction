The Main script to run is Prediction_Main.py..

This script will run all the others.. Move the required folders into the Http_directory and then launch the webserver... From there you should be able to access what you need via http://localhost:8000/... If 8000 is in use then you will need to modify the port in Python_Web_Server.py

You can also use the docker container that has been build.. But the files are effectively as you see here...

The Docker File format is AMD64
